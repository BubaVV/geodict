Refactor populate_database.py to LOAD DATA INFILE method - should be much much faster
Population should have DEFAULT 0
Change configuration to dictionary with default values
Maybe introduce tests? But they depends on MySQL
Regions table seems to fail at load
Add Readme.rst
Introduce downloading of source, maybe compressed
